# Handwritten Digit Recognition using Deep Learning

This project uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to recognize handwritten digits (0â€“9) from the MNIST dataset.

## ðŸ§  Problem Statement

Build a deep learning model that can accurately classify handwritten digits using image data, and deploy it via a simple web application.

## âœ… Proposed Solution

We use a CNN architecture to extract features from digit images and classify them. The model is trained on the MNIST dataset and deployed with Flask for real-time prediction.

## ðŸ”§ Technologies Used

- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow / Keras
- NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib
